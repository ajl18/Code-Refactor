Finished URL for website: 


Steps completed:
1. Changed title from generic "website" to name of company, "Horiseon"
2. Fixed formatting of html so everything followed logical pattern (head and body tabbed in)
3. "Search Engine Optimization" link was not working - fixed by adding both "id" to <div> element
4. Annotated css style so someone else could follow logically
5. Consolidated the benefits class color (white), as each child element was duplicating a property that could be assigned to the parent class
6. Consolidated duplicate css code by applying to multiple classes separating by a comma (vs separate code for each class)
7. Remove repetitive css for .benefit-lead, .benefit-brand, .benefit-cost classes
8. Increased margin below benefit classes to match mock up (right side extends below left)
9. For accessibility, added alt="" for all <img> elements. If they were important images that needed explanation, I would have added relevant details in the "". However, all the images in this case are simple graphics that add visual interest, but don't add to the utility of the website.
